    About My Hobbys.
    
        <p> The reason I love to code is because you can go a long way with it. Coding is also fun because you can create things nobody has done before and use your imagination. You can also make apps that can defend against attckers by blocking PUP (potentially unwanted software) out of ones computer. I like swimming because I like to swim in water </p>
